The 5G SMS Firewall project aims to enhance the security and eﬃciency of SMS communications
within 5G networks. By creating an innovative and unprecedented decentralised and modular
firewall, this system addresses the growing need for robust and scalable solutions to mitigating
threats such as spam, phishing and unauthorised access in SMS traﬃc. The system leverages 5G
network simulation technologies including OMNeT++, INET and Simu5G to simulate a realistic 5G
network to develop and test firewall functionalities in a controlled environment.

The Firewall integrates cloud-based processing, machine learning for phishing detection and an
intuitive administrative dashboard. It ensure seamless SMS routing, filtering and delivery, while
safeguarding against malicious activities. This system operates in harmony with the simulated 5G
components, enabling comprehensive testing before deployment in live networks.

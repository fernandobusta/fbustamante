## Business Location Optimisation

- **Overview:** Developed a project during my first and second years of college, aimed at predicting optimal locations for physical businesses to enhance their chances of success.
- **Problem Statement:**
  - With bankruptcy declarations in the EU at an all-time high since 2015 and 99% of businesses categorised as small or medium-sized enterprises, only 50% of small businesses survive beyond five years.
- **Research Insights:**
  - Location significantly impacts operational efficiency, brand perception, and customer access. Selecting the right site can reduce job loss, environmental impact, and the risk of bankruptcy.
- **Goal:**
  - To assist small businesses in gaining a competitive edge in an increasingly challenging environment by identifying optimal locations for establishment or expansion. The project envisions a platform where businesses can access relevant data, compare reviews, and analyse pricing against competitors.
- **Technical Implementation:**
  - Utilised Google Maps API to process data, including reviews, accessibility, and general pricing metrics, to inform location decisions.
- **Presentations:**
  - Presented our concept at the SISTEM Conference, sponsored by industry leaders such as Mastercard, Stripe and SIG. https://sistemconf.com/
  - Participated in the Enactus National Competition in Ireland, advocating for our idea and its potential economic benefits. https://enactusuki.org/
